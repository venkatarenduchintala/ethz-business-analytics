```{r Point Plot comparing age and pulse of participants}
#create the sample data frame with age and pulse of the participants
line_data <- data.frame(s.studentAnswers$Pulse, s.studentAnswers$Age)
ggplot(line_data, aes(x = line_data$s.studentAnswers.Age, y = line_data$s.studentAnswers.Pulse)) + geom_point()
