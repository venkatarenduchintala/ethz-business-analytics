# Guidelines

This sheet presents a collection of exercises as part of the first practical session. It is designed as 'do-it-yourself' process where you can ask questions interactively upon request. The goal of this sheet is that you can control your own pace and specifically shift your attention to the areas where you think it is best to build up expertise. 

Our recommendations:

* Choose the sections depending your prior knowledge.

* Ask questions! Reach out to your neighbors or the teaching assistants. As a first step, it is also wise to consult the official help pages or a websearch. 

* Follow up with the background materials where necessary. We compiled slide decks concerning several focus areas (introduction to R, data analsis, plotting with ggplot2). These should cover all relevant materials; however, you might find it more effective either to skim the materials or search for background literature online. 

* This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. We also uploaded a short tutorial on R Markdown. 

# Introduction to R

This section is designed to review the basic functionality of R. 

* Level: beginners

* Accompanying materials: 1_IntroductionR.pdf (please go through this material briefly before running the exercises)

* Goals: after this section, you will be able to perform simple calculations in R, utilize variables and handle vectors/matrices. 

## First steps

As a very first step, run the following example to validate that it really outputs 21. You can do so by clicking the green ">" on the right side of the text editor. Alternatively, try executing this chunk by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
3.5 * (4 + 2)
```

Next, calculate the numeric value of '16 thirds'.

```{r}

```

R will also tell you when something goes wrong and indicates a potential reason. As an example, experiment with the following expression for which the value is not defined mathematically. 

```{r}
0 / 0
```

Here is another example where the expression is incomplete. See what happens and then fix it such that it computes to 2.75. 

```{r}
3 / 4 +
```

The editor also recognizes comments for which the rest of the current line will be ignored during execution. Comments are  Think what the expected result should be for the following expression before execution.

```{r}
3 + 4 # + 2
```

You can consult the built-in help pages in R via the following command:

```{r}
help(sin)
```


## Operations, functions and variables

Try the logical operators to check whether the square root of 8 is really smaller than 3.

```{r}

```

Is 4 equal to the square root of 16? 

```{r}

```

Now define a variable 'z' and set its value to 3. Then increment its value by one.

```{r}

```

What will be the value of 'z' after executing the following code?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 2
x <- x + 1
y <- 4
z <- x + y
x <- x + 1
z <- z + x
```

## Vectors and matrices

Given is the following vector. What is its length? What is the value of its second element? Afterwards append a new value zero at the beginning. What is the new value of the second element?

```{r}
set.seed(0)
a <- sample.int(10)

# enter your answer here
```

We now want to check the summary statistics of the above vector 'a'. What are its mean, variance, standard deviation and summed value?

```{r}

```

Compute the sum overall integers from 1 to 100.

```{r}

```

Assign the value 15 to a variable 'x' and create a vector 'y' with the values [ 1, 2, 3, 10, 100]. Multiply those vectors component-wise and save the result in an object 'z'. Calculate the sum of all elements in 'z'.

```{r}

```

Generate a sequence from 0 to 10 and a sequence from 5 to -5.

```{r}

```

Generate a sequence from -3 to 3 by 0.1 steps.

```{r}

```

Define two vectors with the following data: 't' includes the strings "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat"; and 'm' includes 
[90, 80, 50, 20, 5, 20].  Concatenate both vectors column-wise into a matrix with 6 rows and 2 columns and save this a a new object named 'study'.

```{r}

```



## Data handling

Loading data is usually a bit tricky at the first time and we thus have provided an additional sheet 'Loading Data into R.pdf'. As a general rule, it is usually convenient to work with CSV files (i.e. if you have an Excel sheet, one must first convert it to CSV). 

We provided a file 'persons.csv'. Look at its content first as a CSV file and then load it into R. Try the following alternatives:

* In R Studio, click Tools > Import Dataset > From Text File ...

* Try the code option with 'read.csv(file.choose(), header=TRUE, sep= ",")'

* Use the previous command but add an explicit path to the file. Think about it: what could be a potential benefit of it? 

```{r}

```

Next, determine the size, the column names and their type.

```{r}

```

Filter for all persons with name 'Robin'.

```{r}

```

Filter for all persons with name 'Robin' or age above 50.

```{r}

```

Create the following data frame. Calculate the minimum and maximum value in the column 'age'. Obviously, there have been some issues collecting the data. Generate a variable 'selection' that contains the result to the logical query of 'age under 20 and above 80'. Use this variable to set the age observations to 'NA' if age is under 20 or above 80.
Then calculate the Body Mass Index BMI = Weight [in kg] / (Length [in m])^2 of all people from the previous data frame. Store the results in a variable BMI and append it to your data frame. Round the resulting values.

age | sex | height | weight
21  | m   | 181    | 69
35  | f   | 173    | 58 
829 | m   | 171    | 75
2   | e   | 166    | 60

```{r}

```



# Control Flow

This section is designed to control the operation of code inside R (i.e. if-clauses, loops, etc.). It will be beneficial later but you can also come to it later when you find it necessary. 

* Level: intermediate

* Accompanying materials: see corresponding section in 1_IntroductionR.pdf (please go through this material briefly before running the exercises)

* Goals: after this section, you will be able to implement if-clauses, loops and functions. 

## Conditional statements and loops

Print all odd numbers on the screen in the range from 1 to 10 using a while-loop.

```{r}

```

Now print all odd numbers using a for-loop. 

```{r}

```

## Nested statements

Create a vector containing all integer numbers from 7 to 50. Then use a for loop to double every number that is divisible by 7.

Hint: you can use the module operator %% to see if a number is divisible by another. Examples are as follows:

```{r}
15 %% 4  # 15 is not divisible by 4
15 %% 3  # 15 is divisible by 3
15 %% 5  # 15 is divisible by 5
```


```{r}

```

## Functions

Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number. Use a non-recursive function to do so. Calculate 10! afterwards. Wha happens if you evaluate your function with input 0, -1, NA or an empty string?

Hint: the factor is defined as n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 2 * 1. For instance, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. By definition, 0! := 1. 

```{r}

```


# Built-in visualization

This section is designed to introduce the native plotting capabilities of R. 

* Level: intermediate

* Accompanying materials: see 2_DataVisualization.pdf; based on these materials, you will experiment with 5 new commands, namely, 'plot()', 'boxplot()', 'hist()', 'qqplot()' and 'qqline()'. 

* Goals: after this section, you will be able to implement if-clauses, loops and functions. 

## Line plots

Generate a sequence from -3 to 3 by 0.1 steps. Plot the function y = 5-x^2 with x being the previously generated sequence. What does the function look like?

```{r}

```

## Boxplot

The following table gives the murders in New Jersey by date of the week:

```{r}
murder <- c(53, 42, 51, 45, 36, 37, 65)
names(murder) <- c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")
```

Visualize the distribution as a boxplot.

```{r}

```

## Histogram

Change the previous plot to a histogram.

```{r}

```

## Q-Q plot

Is it normally distributed? Use an Q-Q plot to analyze it.

```{r}

```

# Visualization with ggplot2

This section is designed to leverage the plotting capabilities of 'ggplot2'. 

* Level: advanced

* Accompanying materials: see corresponding section in 3_AdvancedPlotting.pdf 

* Goals: after this section, you will be able to create plots with ggplot2 and adapt their layout.  

## Preparation

As a preparation, load the 'ggplot2' package. Note that you must install it prior to the first use:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

In the following, we will use the dataset 'mtcars' that includes horse power (column: 'hp') and fuel efficiency (column: 'mpg') for various cars. You can load the data as follows:

```{r}
data("mtcars")
```

## First steps

The usual call for ggplot2 is sketched in the follow. You pass once the dataset and which columns go on the x- and y-axis. Additionally, you need to choose what type of plot you want to obtain. For instance, you get a point plot by choosing 'geom_point'. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = column_x, y = column_y)) +
  geom_TYPE()
```

Now prepare a simple point plot with horse power vs. fuel efficiency by adapting the above code template.

```{r}

```

## Combing geometric elements

ggplot2 has several caveats that increase flexibilitiy:

* The function call to 'aes()' stores which columns go where. It can not only be passed to 'ggplot()' where it is set globally for all geometric structure. One can also set axes inside the call to 'geom_TYPE()'; for instance, 'geom_point(aes(y = column_y))'. 

* One can combine several layers by concating elements with a '+'. 

Let's try the above: Plot the following functions in one plot for a range of [-5, 5]:

* f1(x) = 3^x

* f2(x) = 10 * x * sin(x^2)

* f3(x) = x^3

```{r}

```

## Trend lines

Add a trendline to the previous dataset 'mtcars' (see function 'geom_smooth()').

```{r}

```

## Annotations 

Change the descriptions of both axes and choose a printer-friendly theme.

```{r}

```

## Coloring

ggplot2 has functionality for changing colors (e.g. the routine 'scale_fill_manual'). Look up the corresponding materials and then change the colors of the points according to the variable 'cyl'.

Hint: some arguments expect a discrete choice of values and one must thus convert it to a factor via 'as.factor()'.

```{r}

```


## Switching from wide to long data formas

Load the 'USArrests' data set and use the 'resample2' library to convert the data into the long format. Then create a scatter plotting the crimes against the percentage of urban population of a state.

```{r}
  
```
